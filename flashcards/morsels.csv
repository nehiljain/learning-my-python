"What is tuple unpacking?","Multiple assignment. For example: x, y = 1, 2."
"How to make a object work with multiple assigment? For example: x, y = Point(1, 2)","Make it a an iterable. Like def __iter__(): yield"
"What is the formula for polynomial hash code? What is a potential problem of this function?","Horner's rule, xn−1 +a(xn−2 +a(xn−3 +···+a(x2 +a(x1 +ax0))···)). The repr overflows but we ignore it"
"How does cyclic shift hash code work?","Choose 5 or x number of bits to shift you sum all the bits of the string representation"
"What type of objects are hashable in python?","Immutable only hash(x)"
"Are user defined classes hashable?","No by default in Python. Custom implementation can be done using __hash__"
